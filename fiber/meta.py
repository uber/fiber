    fiber.meta API allows you to decorate your function and provide some hints to
    Fiber. Currently this is mainly used for specify the resource usage of user
    functions.

    Currently, support keys are:

    | key                   | Type | Default | Notes |
    | --------------------- |:------|:-----|:------|
    | cpu                   | int   | None | The number of CPU cores that this function needs |
    | memory                | int   | None | The size of memory space in MB this function needs |
    | gpu                   | int   | None | The number of GPUs that this function needs. For how to setup Fiber with GPUs, check out [here](advanced.md#using-fiber-with-gpus) |

    Example usage:

    ```python
    @fiber.meta(cpu=4, memory=1000, gpu=1)
    def func():
        do_something()
    ```
    """
    for k in kwargs:
        assert k in VALID_META_KEYS, "Invalid meta argument \"{}\"".format(k)

    def decorator(func):
        meta = post_process(kwargs)
        func.__fiber_meta__ = meta
        return func

    return decorator
