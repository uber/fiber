"""
Fiber introduces a new concept called *job-backed processes*. It is similar to
the *process* in Python's multiprocessing library, but more flexible: while a
process in multiprocessing only runs on a local machine, a Fiber process can
run remotely on a different machine or locally on the same machine.

When starting a new Fiber process, Fiber creates a new job with the proper Fiber
backend on the current computer cluster. Fiber uses containers to encapsulate
the running environment of current processes, including all the required files,
input data, and other dependent program packages, etc., to ensure everything is
self-contained. All the child processes are started with the same container
image as the parent process to guarantee a consistent running environment.

Because each process is a cluster job, its life cycle is the same as any job on
the cluster.

    The API is compatible with Python's multiprocessing.Process, check
    [here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html#process-and-exceptions)
    for multiprocessing's documents.

    Example usage:

    ```python
    p = Process(target=f, args=('Fiber',))
    p.start()
    ```

    ###pid

    ```
    Process.pid
    ```

    Return the current process PID. If the process hasn't been fully started,
    the value will be `None`. This PID is assigned by Fiber and is different
    from the operating system process PID. The value of `pid` is derived from
    the job ID of the underlying job that runs this Fiber process.

    ###name
    ```
    Process.name
    ```

    Return the name of this Fiber process. This value need to be set before the
    start of the Process.

    Example:
    ```python
    p = fiber.Process(target=print, args=("demo"))
    p.name = "DemoProcess"
    ```

    ###daemon

    ```
    Process.daemon
    ```

    In multiprocessing, if a process has daemon set, it will be terminated when
    it's parent process exits. In Fiber, current this value has no effect, all
    processes will be cleaned up when their parent exits.

    ###authkey

    ```
    Process.authkey
    ```
    Authkey is used to authenticate between parent and child processes. It is
    a byte string.

    ###exitcode

    ```
    Process.exitcode
    ```
    The exit code of current process. If the process has not exited, the
    exitcode is `None`. If the current process has exited, the value of this
    is an integer.

    ###sentinel

    ```
    Process.sentinel
    ```
    Returns a file descriptor that becomes "ready" when the process exits. You
    can call `select` and other eligible functions that works on fds on this
    file descriptor.
